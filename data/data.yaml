properties:
  - name: action
    description: |
      Git action to execute.

      Supported actions: `clone | commit | push | pages`. Specified actions are executed in the specified order

      - **clone:** Clones the repository in `remote_url` and checks out the `branch` to `path`.
      - **commit:** Adds a commit to the default repository or the repository in `remote_url`.
      - **push:** Pushes all commits to the default repository or the repository set in `remote_url`.
      - **pages:** The `pages` action is a special action that cannot be combined with other actions. It is intended for use for
        GitHub pages. It synchronizes the contents of `pages_directory` with the target `branch` using `rsync` and pushes the changes automatically.
